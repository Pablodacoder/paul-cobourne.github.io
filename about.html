        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I’m Paul Cobourne, a Computer Science student with a strong interest in
            IT support, networking, and systems administration. I enjoy working
            hands-on with systems, troubleshooting problems, and learning how
            technology works under the hood.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’ve completed IT-focused training through Per Scholas, where I gained
            experience with Windows environments, Active Directory fundamentals,
            basic networking concepts, and technical troubleshooting. Alongside
            this, I’m continuing to build my programming skills through my CS
            coursework and personal projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            This website is a place for me to showcase my projects, document what
            I’m learning and tracking my growth as I work toward a career in IT and
            technology.
