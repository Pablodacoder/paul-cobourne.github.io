            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
            I’m Paul Cobourne, a Computer Science student with a strong interest in
            IT support, networking, and systems administration. I enjoy working
            hands-on with technology—troubleshooting issues, setting up systems,
            and understanding how everything works behind the scenes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through my training with Per Scholas and my academic coursework, I’ve
            gained practical experience with Windows environments, Active Directory
            fundamentals, basic networking concepts, and technical problem-solving.
            I like structured environments where I can organize systems, improve
            processes, and make things run more efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>
            I built this website to document my learning, showcase my projects,
            and track my growth as I continue developing my skills. I’m motivated
            to keep learning, take on new challenges, and work toward a long-term
            a career in IT and technology.
